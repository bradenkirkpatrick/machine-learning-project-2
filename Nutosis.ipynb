    "For this project you must go through most steps in the checklist. You must write responses for all items however sometimes the item will simply be \"does not apply\". Some of the parts are a bit more nebulous and you simply show that you have done things in general (and the order doesn't really matter). Keep your progress and thoughts organized in this document and use formatting as appropriate (using markdown to add headers and sub-headers for each major part). Do not do the final part (launching the product) and your presentation will be done as information written in this document in a dedicated section, no slides or anything like that. It should however include the best summary plots/graphics/data points.\n",

    "You are intentionally given very little information thus far. You must communicate with your client (me) for additional information as necessary. But also make sure that your communications are efficient, thought out, and not redundant as your client might get frustrated and \"fire\" you (this only applies to getting information from your client, this does not necessary apply to asking for help with the actual project itself - you should continuously ask questions for getting help).\n",

    "2. **How will your solution be used?** Used to manage or help prevent the spread or cause of deaths of squirrels.\n",
    "3. **How should you frame this problem?** A classification problem that uses set parameters to determine if a squirrel will die or not.\n",
    "4. **How should performance be measured? Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?** Accuracy and f1 score so we can accurately predict positives and try and mitigate the false positives.\n",
    "5. **What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?** Probably a f1 score in the 70 or 80 percent range.\n",
    "6. **What are comparable problems? Can you reuse (personal or readily available) experience or tools?** None personal but probably some wildlife studies readily available online.\n",
    "7. **Is human expertise available?** Some studies online by scientists focusing on urban animals.\n",
    "8. **How would you solve the problem manually?** Find dead squirrels and try and find similar traits between them all and then compare to living squirrels and see if the traits we believe to cause the deaths is correct or not and reevaluate.\n",
    "9. **List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far. Verify assumptions if possible.** The data accurately can help track what causes deaths, fur color has an effect on deaths, and there are no seasonal or disease related effects that we know of."
